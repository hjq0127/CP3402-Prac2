# Learning activities and resources
This week, I focused on how to use Joomla to design and publish website-related sub-themes. I set up a child theme specifically to make a website using joomla and make it accessible online. After completing the practical exercises, I also explored the YouTube course and learned how to add more style to the Joomla website and insert images. I also looked into website design templates. I believe that a thorough understanding of the subtopics will be helpful in our group assignments.

# Estimated Time
I spent approximately 5 hours of personal time this week studying this sub-theme, including the time spent on the prac2.
# Insights on Content
Joomla themes provide an introductory foundation for creating websites and simplify a lot of the coding aspects, but more so how to use the tool. It helped me build a simple website very quickly instead of starting from scratch. Through this week's study, I also gained confidence in using to build websites. I learned how to build a website using Joomla, ways to expose this website and explored website templates. Overall, it has enhanced my understanding and learning of how websites are published.
# Insights on Career/Employment/Learning
After completing the practical exercises, I started watching YouTube courses on the topic to see if they provided additional insights that I wouldn't get from the practical exercises alone. I did learn some additional ways to use controls that I didn't touch on in web design, such as different ways to add images. It's not just adding them in the article. You can use direct image additions and add urls to make the images super. Links, which can be useful for creating finer details when building the site in the future. Based on my study strategy this week, I concluded that this approach of reading the guide, doing the practice exercises, and then revisiting the tutorials worked for me. However, I need more practice and should look for more resources instead of just relying on watching videos to understand.
